            var:- The scope of a var variable is functional scope. It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.It can be accessed without initialization as its default value is “undefined”.hoisting done , with initializing as default value.It can be declared without initialization.
        </p><br>
        <p>let: The scope of a let variable is block scope. It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope. It cannot be accessed without initialization otherwise it will give referenceError. Hoisting is done , but not initialized (this is the reason for error when we access the let variable before declaration</p><br>
        <p>
            const: The scope of a const variable is block scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope. It cannot be declared without initialization. It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization.

        <h1 class="text-xl p-4">.forEach(), .map(), .filter() .... What's the difference?</h1>
        <p >
            .forEach: is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
        </p><br>
        <p >
            .map(): executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
        </p><br>
        <p >
            .filter(): checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.

        <h1 class="text-xl p-4">difference between arrow function and regular function</h1>
        <p >
            avaScript's arrow functions might seem the same as regular functions on the surface, but they have some very important differences:

            Syntactical differences
            this value (execution context)
            Usage as methods
            Usage as constructors
            arguments binding
            Syntax
            The first and most obvious difference between arrow functions and regular functions is their syntax. Not only do they look different, but arrow functions also provide an implicit return shorthand and allow parenthesis around a single argument to be omitted.
            Execution context
Inside a regular function, execution context (i.e. the value of this) is dynamic. This means that the value of this depends on how the function was invoked (simple invocation, method invocation, indirect invocation or constructor invocation). On the other hand, an arrow function does not define its own execution context. This results in an arrow function's this being resolved lexically (i.e. the scope in which the arrow function was defined).
Methods
Due to arrow functions not defining their own execution context, they're not well-suited for usage as methods. However, thanks to the Class fields proposal, arrow functions can be used as methods inside classes, if your environment supports it.
